# Make Variables Not War

### Setup

1. Navigate to this directory in your terminal.
2. Run `npm install` to install the testing library.
3. Preferably in a full-screen terminal, run `npm test` to start testing.


### Workflow

You'll be working in `main.js`, creating the variables needed with the values asked for, according to the specifications given in the tests. Check your terminal for feedback on which aspect of the problem you have yet to complete, and read `main.test.js` for the specifications' actual code implementation; it makes explicit exactly what outputs are expected given the test inputs.


### Guidelines:

* Unless you absolutely have to modify a variable, it should be declared with `const`.
* If you are asked to define a variable in terms of another, do not recalculate the value of that variable. For example, if x = 5, and y = 6, and z is supposed to be x + y, do NOT set y to equal 5 + 6 directly. Use the variables instead.


### Tasks

* Create a variable called myFirstName. Assign myFirstName a string value that represents your first name.
* Create a variable called myLastName. Assign myLastName a string value that represents your last name.
* Create a variable called myBestFriend. Assign myBestFriend a string value that represents your best friend name.
* Create a variable called mySentence. Assign mySentence a string that includes your first name, last name, and best friend from the preceding variables.
* Create another variable called myFavoriteNum. Assign myFavoriteNum a number value that represents your favorite number!
* Create another variable called myMentalAge. Assign myMentalAge a number value that represents your mental age!
* Create another variable called myHeight. Assign myHeight a number value that represents your height in inches or centimeters!
* Create another variable called myFavoriteYear. Assign myFavoriteYear a number value that represents your favorite year!


### Tasks that use MATH

* Create another variable called mySum. Set it equal to the result of three plus one thousand nine hundred eighteen plus twenty-four + one. Calculate it in code!
* Create another variable called myProduct. Set it equal to the result of  two hundred thirty-two times forty-three divided by two plus four (the operations should be written in that order!). Calculate it in code!
* Create another variable called heightAndAge. Set it equal to the sum of your mental age and height. Calculate it in code!
